## 👋 Who Am I?

I'm someone who genuinely loves tinkering with electronics, microcontrollers, and IoT systems. By day, I work with ThingWorx, but what really gets me excited is experimenting with DIY projects, pushing the boundaries of what small boards can do, and sharing everything I learn with the community through video tutorials and open-source code.

**What I'm Into Right Now:**
- 🏠 Building home automation setups (OpenHAB, Node-RED, Grafana stacks)
- 🔌 Playing with ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and other microcontroller boards
- 📡 Exploring LoRaWAN, BLE, and other wireless protocols
- 🎥 Creating YouTube tutorials and documentation for projects
- 🐳 Containerizing everything with Docker (because why not?)
- 🤝 Helping others get started with IoT and embedded systems

## 💡 Why I Do This

I genuinely believe that IoT and embedded systems are becoming more accessible and exciting every day. Whether it's automating your home, tracking environmental data, or just pushing the limits of what a microcontroller can do—there's always something fascinating to explore. I love sharing what I learn because the IoT community has taught me so much, and I want to give back.
